# regexp
My notes about Regular Expressions.

**A regular expression** is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern.

## Base
`()` - a marked subexpression (group).

`|` - or (alternative).
`(H|h)` - 1st alternative is `H', 2st is `h`. 

## Flags
`/g` - global, don't return after first match.

`/i` - insensitive, case insensitive match.



## Testing
I use [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/?editors=0010) and [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) for RegExp tests.
